Read a contab file and run until stopped, executing the task schedule
described in the file. 

The first 5 fields of the crontab file set the schedule, and the 
following fields are passed to a shell for execution.

On Unix-like systems the default shell is /bin/sh
On Windows the value of environment variable COMSPEC is used.

The --seconds flag is provided, an extra seconds field is expected
in each crontab line

The --exec flag may be used to provide a single crontab record on
the command line instead of reading a crontab file.

Example crontab line:
    * * * * * path_to_command -flag params >/var/log/output
